	<h3> Formulas </h3>
	<p> In a Quadratic equation, when \(a \ne 0\), there are two solutions to \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) and they are \[x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.\]
		</p> \[ f(n) = \begin{cases} n/2 & \quad \text{if } n \text{ is even}\\ -(n+1)/2 & \quad \text{if } n \text{ is odd} \end{cases}
	\] <p> \[ \sum_{i=1}^{10} t_i \] \[ \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} = \binom{n}{k} \] </p>
	<br>
			<p> The Pythagorean Theorem States that in a Right Triangle, \[ a^2 +  b^2 = c^2\].
				<br>
				The Law of Sines States that in a non-right triangle, \[\frac{A}{sin(a)} = \frac{B}{sin(b)} = \frac{C}{sin(c)}\]
				<br>
				The formula for calculating the Square of a number is: \[v = b^2\]
				<br>
				Also, the formula for calculating the volume of a cube is: \[V = b^3\]
				<br>
				The formula for calculating the area of a rectangle is: \[v = bh\]
				To find slope of a line or equation, you use the following equation: \[y = mx + b\]
				<br>
				In addition, the formula for calculating the volume of a rectangular prism is: \[V = BH\], where \(B\), as a capital letter , is equal to \(bh\), and \(H\), also a capital letter, being the height of the three-dimensional figure.
				<br>
				The area of a circle is: \[A = \pi r^2\]
				<br>
				However, the equation for the volume of a cylinder is: \[V = \pi r^2 h\]
				<br>
				Furthermore, the equation for the volume of a cone is: \[V = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h\]
				<br>
				And lastly, the volume of a sphere can be calculated with the following equation: \[V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3\]
				<br>
				</p>
				<h3> Functions </h3>
				<br>
				<p>The standard format for a function is: \[f(x) = \]The right side of this equation is an operation that could also be any of the formulas from above, with the exception of the Quadratic Formula.
